# IoT Synchronized Light
Personal information, such as the Wi-Fi access information, has been removed from the SDK config and will need to be reconfigured. 

The current MQTT access token may be expired, sign up for a Flespi account, activate a new token, and replace the current line in SDK config if necessary. 

This project is based in part on the ESP-MQTT sample application from Espressif and ESP-IDF.
